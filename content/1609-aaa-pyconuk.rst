Resources
---------

* `Google-style docstrings
  <http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html>`_:
  In addition to using this style in my AAA tests, I've started to add a
  ``Trusts`` section to indicate which other tests are trusted by any
  particular test and why.

* `Bill Wake's post about AAA
  <http://xp123.com/articles/3a-arrange-act-assert/>`_: Bill Wake is cited by
  Kent Beck as having coined the term ``3A``.

* `Extract Method <http://refactoring.com/catalog/extractMethod.html>`_: I've
  used extract method as defined by Martin Fowler. See also `Extract Variable
  <http://refactoring.com/catalog/extractVariable.html>`_.

Finally

Thanks again to `Carles <https://github.com/txels>`_ for introducing me to the
AAA pattern. Check out his `data driven tests library
<https://github.com/txels/ddt>`_.
