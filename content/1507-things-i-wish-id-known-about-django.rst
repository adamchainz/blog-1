:summary: Django has been my go-to web framework for about three years. But I
          wish I'd started with it sooner. This became a talk which I gave at
          the London Django meetup in July this year.

This month at `The London Django meetup
<https://www.meetup.com/The-London-Django-Meetup-Group/events/223297765/>`_ I
gave a talk about some of the things I wish I'd known about Django (before I
started).

Thanks
------

My thanks to `Piotr <https://github.com/zalun>`_, who I mentioned in the talk.
For years he told me to check out `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_
because "it does things right". Only when I'd truly broken myself with PHP did
I take his advice and I haven't looked back.

Django opened the door for me to:

* **Python** which has become my backend language of choice.

* **Test Driven Development** which has become a way of life.

More Power
----------

When I'm developing for web and using Django, I think it's possible for me to
keep more features live with fewer errors than was previously possible for me
with PHP based tools. I put this down to two main things:

* The application of tests in my Django projects. I'm particularly happy with
  the test suite provided by Django. Where I've needed to rewire it or patch
  it, it's responded well.

* The structure that Django provides, without enforcing how projects are built.

Summary
-------

I wish I'd jumped into Django sooner. If you're thinking about transitioning to
it, see what you can do today. I think it pays back in the long run.

Grab me on `Twitter <https://twitter.com/jamesfublo/>`_ to share any thoughts.

Thanks for reading.
