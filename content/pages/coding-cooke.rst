Web development
---------------

My core work focus is on server-side development, so day to day I'm
predominantly developing code that creates, validates and manages data, usually
serving it to a web or mobile app.

Currently my preferred tools are `Linux
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux>`_, `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_,
`vim <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)>`_, Bic Medium black
ballpoint pens, notebooks and whiteboards.

During my time in the web development field, I've held a number of different
roles, from specification and design, to implementation, management and
testing. A full breakdown is available on my `CV
<{filename}/docs/james_cooke_cv.pdf>`_.
