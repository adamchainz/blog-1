Web development
---------------

My work focuses primarily on server-side development - that means that day to
day I'm mainly developing code that creates, validates and manages data,
usually serving it to a web or mobile app.

Currently my preferred tools are `Linux
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux>`_, `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_,
`vim <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)>`_, Bic Medium black
ballpoint pens, notebooks and whiteboards.

During my time working in the web development field I've held in a number of
different development roles - from specification and design, to implementation,
management and testing. A full breakdown is on my `CV

Coding Cooke is part of a Brighton based tribe of creative micro-businesses
called `Studio Awkward <https://studioawkward.co.uk>`_.
