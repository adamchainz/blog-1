About
-----

I'm a server-side development contractor based in London. I work mainly with
`Linux <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux>`_, `Python
<https://www.python.org/>`_, `vim
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)>`_, whiteboards and hopefully
as many excellent people as possible.

During my time working in the web development field I've held in a number of
different development roles - from specification and design, to implementation,
management and testing. A full breakdown is on my `CV
