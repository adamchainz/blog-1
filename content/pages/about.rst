Hello, my name is James
#######################

I'm a London-based web developer working mainly with Python.

Web is my thing - I focus on backend development.

Previously, I've worked as a freelancer, run a mini web agency called Fublo, worked at a social music startup, done some stuff at Time Out London and Time Out International and now I work at a startup called `Quibly <http://quib.ly>`_.
