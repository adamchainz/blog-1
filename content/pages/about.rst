Hello, my name is James
#######################

I'm a London-based web development contractor, working mainly with Linux,
Python, vim, whiteboards and hopefully as many excellent people as possible.

During my time with web, I've worked in a number of different roles focused on
development - from the specification and design, to implementation, management
and test. A full breakdown is on my `StackOverflow Careers profile
<http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jamescooke/>`_.

You can contact me about any potential projects by emailing me on `hi AT
jamescooke DOT info`.
