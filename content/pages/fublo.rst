... previously a digital agency
-------------------------------

Hi. You're looking at this page because you've followed a link to a page on
`fublo.net` - this was previously the website of Fublo Ltd, a small digital
agency in London that closed in August 2012.


Previous work
-------------

My name is James, and I was previously an owner and a director of Fublo.

"Soon" I'll write up the work that `Mark <https://twitter.com/markjenkins>`_,
`Oliver <https://twitter.com/OliverCaldwell>`_ and I did for clients like
Fallon London, Time Out and We Are Social.

Now we're each pursuing different careers working on various projects, but
still all based in London.


Current work
------------

Currently I'm working as a Python contractor, mainly on web projects. There's
more information and my contact details on the `About page
</pages/hello-my-name-is-james.html>`_.

Thanks for stopping by.
