My first experiments with Pelican to run this blog have been good. It's currently built on the Pelican-svbtle theme.

In my opinion, there were some problems with the theme in its current form on the **XXX** branch. So I've forked **XXX***'s version, cleaned out some of the LESS and templates.

I quite like the version of the WP_Svbtle theme that **wp geezer** is using on his site... So if it's possible to make a Pelican version of that, I might hope over to that. One of the best things about WordPress is that the themes are well developed and configurable compared to some other blogging systems.
