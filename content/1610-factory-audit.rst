Factories build instances of models, primarily for testing, but can be used
anywhere. In this post I present my attempts at grading different factory
libraries available for Django based on the validity of the instances that they
create.

The Problem
-----------

You're a much better programmer than me - I'm a bad programmer. I make
mistakes, lots of them. I often forget to validate my instances before saving.
In order for my tests to be more dependable and solid, I'd like whatever object
factory I use to look after me by validating the generated instance before it
reaches the database.

This is the way that I've been looking at Django model instances - for a single
model we can imagine sets of instances which might look like:

.. image:: |filename|/images/venn.png
    :alt: Venn diagram showing sets of Django model instances grouped by
        validity.
    :width: 500

Where:

* ``Îµ``: The universal set of all possible instances of this model.

* ``D``: The set of instances that the database would consider valid. It's
  interesting to note that this set might change as code is developed, tested
  and run on machines that have different database versions or use different
  databases altogether.

* ``V``: The set of valid instances which pass ``full_clean``. This is a subset
  of ``D``.

The main issue is the set ``D/V`` of instances. These are all the instances
which can be saved into the database but are considered invalid by Django.

When factories create instances that reside in this set, they create
instability in the system:

* If a user attempts to edit that instance through the Django Admin system,
  then they may not be able to save their changes without fixing a list of
  invalid fields.

* Test suites will be executed using model instances that *should* not be
  created during the "normal" lifetime of the application.

Possible solutions
------------------

We could argue that way in which Django does not call ``full_clean`` before it
writes instances to the database is the root of the problem - I've previously
`written and spoken about this
<{filename}/1511-django-save-vs-fullclean.rst>`_. However, this is more a
"condition of the environment" and therefore something that we need to manage,
rather than fix.

Also, look at it another way. Any factory that integrates with Django can
inspect the target model and immediately find the constraints on each field. In
the case of ``Item`` that means a ``name`` field with a single unique
character. Therefore with Django, factory libraries have all the information
they need to build a strategy for creating valid data. On top of that, Django
provides the ``full_clean`` function so any generated data can also be checked
for validity before it's sent to the database. Why should we have to re-code
the constraints already created for our models into our factories? This looks
like duplication of work.

So let's explore how different factory libraries deal with this problem of
instances in the ``D/V`` set - the white of the fried egg in the diagram.

Factory libraries
-----------------

The following factory libraries have been explored:

* `Django Fakery <https://github.com/fcurella/django-fakery>`_

* `Factory Boy <https://github.com/FactoryBoy/factory_boy>`_

  - `Factory Djoy <https://github.com/jamescooke/factory_djoy>`_

* `Hypothesis[django] <https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/django.html>`_

* `Mixer <https://github.com/klen/mixer>`_

* `Model Mommy <https://github.com/vandersonmota/model_mommy>`_

Factory Djoy is my factory library. It's a thin wrapper around Factory Boy
which does the hard work. I've indented it because it's really a version of
Factory Boy than a standalone factory library.

Test conditions
---------------

The code used to test the factory libraries is available in the `Factory Audit
repository <https://github.com/jamescooke/factory_audit>`_. For each factory
library, two factories have been created in the default state to create and
save instances of:

* ``ItemFactory``: to create and save instances of ``plant.models.Item``, a
  test model defined `in the 'plant' app
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/factory_audit/blob/master/factory_audit/plant/models.py>`_.

  .. code-block:: python

      class Item(models.Model):
          """
          Single Item with one required field 'name'
          """
          name = models.CharField(max_length=1, unique=True)

  This example has been taken from the `Factory_Djoy README
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/factory_audit>`_ but with a reduced length of
  name down to one character to more easily force name collisions.

* ``UserFactory``: to create and save instances of the default
  ``django.contrib.auth`` User Model.

The goal is that each factory should reliably generate 10 valid instances of
each model.

Wherever possible I've tried to be as explicit as possible and import the
target model, rather than refer to it by name as some factories allow.

Gradings
--------

Each factory library has been graded based on how its default configuration
behaves when used with the ``Item`` and ``User`` models.

The gradings are based on the definition of "valid". Valid instances are ones
which will pass Django's ``full_clean`` and not raise a ``ValidationError``.
For example, using the ``ItemFactory`` a generated item passes validation with:

.. code-block:: python

    item = ItemFactory()
    item.full_clean()

The gradings are:

- |red_circle| RED - Factory creates **invalid** instances of the model and
  saves them to the database. These are instances in the ``D/V`` set.

- |yellow_heart| YELLOW - Factory raises an exception and does not save any
  invalid instances. Preferably this would be a ``ValidationError``, but I've
  also allowed ``IntegrityError`` and ``RunTimeError`` here.

- |green_heart| GREEN - Factory creates multiple **valid** instances with no
  invalid instances created or skipped. Running factory ``n`` times generates
  ``n`` valid instances.

The tests on each of the factories have been written to pass when the factory
behaves to the expected grade. For example, the test on Factory Djoy's
``ItemFactory`` expect that it raises ``ValidationError`` each time it's used
and `is therefore YELLOW grade
<https://github.com/jamescooke/factory_audit/blob/master/factory_audit/plant/tests/test_factory_djoy_factories.py#L12-L20>`_.

Notes about each library
------------------------

Grading each library was often harder than I thought it would be because many
don't fall into one grading or another. Where that has happened I've noted it
below.

Django Fakery
.............

* **ItemFactory** |red_circle| RED

  Unfortunately, Django Fakery does not recognise that only one character is
  allowed for the Item model's ``name`` field. It uses Latin words from a
  generator which are saved by the default SQLite database and are invalid
  because they are too long.

* **UserFactory** |yellow_heart| YELLOW

  In order to create ``User`` instances Django Fakery also uses the Latin
  generator which collides often. This means that ``IntegrityError`` is raised
  when collisions occur, but any Users created are valid.

Factory Boy
...........

* **ItemFactory** |red_circle| RED

  Creates invalid instance of ``Item`` which has no name and saves it.

* **UserFactory** |red_circle| RED

  Creates ``User`` with invalid ``username`` and ``password`` fields and
  saves it.

Factory Boy has no automatic strategies used for default factories and so it
fails this test hard. If the library was extended to call ``full_clean`` for
generated instances before saving then it could be upgraded to YELLOW.

Factory Djoy
............

* **ItemFactory** |yellow_heart| YELLOW

  Calls ``full_clean`` on the ``Item`` instance created by Factory Boy which it
  wraps. This raises ``ValidationError`` and the ``Item`` is not saved.

* **UserFactory** |green_heart| GREEN

  Creates valid instances using a very simple strategy which uses Faker
  Factory already a requirement of Factory Boy. Calls ``full_clean`` on the
  generated instance to catch any collisions in the strategy.

Factory Djoy contains only one simple strategy for creating ``Users``. It has
no inspection ability to create strategies of its own based on Models.

Hypothesis[django]
..................

* **ItemFactory** |red_circle| RED

* **UserFactory** |red_circle| RED

Hypothesis's Django extra does not reliably create instances of either model
because it's ``example`` function does `not reliably generate valid data
<https://github.com/jamescooke/factory_audit/pull/4>`_. In the case that an
invalid example is generated it is skipped and the previous example is used.

Interestingly, Hypothesis creates ``User`` instances that Django considers to
have invalid email addresses.

Mixer
.....

* **ItemFactory** |green_heart| GREEN

  Mixer appears to inspect the ``Item`` model and generates a very limited
  strategy for generating names. Unfortunately it runs out of instances around
  23, even though there are hundreds of characters available.

* **UserFactory** |green_heart| GREEN

Mixer helpfully raises ``Runtime`` error if a strategy can't generate a valid
instance. However, it echoes this to the standard out, which is annoying.

It uses an old version of Fake Factory which meant that its tests had to be
extracted into a second test run that occurs after a ``pip-sync`` has taken
place. I found this the hardest factory library to work with.

Model Mommy
...........

* **ItemFactory** |yellow_heart| YELLOW

  There is no method used to create unique values so there are collisions
  when there are a small number of possible values. Items that are
  created are valid.

* **UserFactory** |green_heart| GREEN

  Model Mommy's random text strategy works here for ``username`` and the random
  strings are unlikely to collide.

Model Mommy depends on its strategies to create valid data and does not call
``full_clean`` meaning that ``IntegrityError`` can be raises when collisions
occur. It could be argued that it should be downgraded to YELLOW because
``IntegrityError`` is raised.


And the winner is?
------------------

What is the best factory to use? This is a really hard question.

These factories consist of two parts and different libraries do each part well.

* Control / API: Personally I really like the Factory Boy API and how it
  interfaces with Django. I'm happy with my own Factory Djoy library because it
  provides me with the certainly of ``full_clean`` for every created instance,
  on top of the Factory Boy API.

* Data strategy: I'm excited by Hypothesis and its ability to generate test
  data.

I think that if Hypothesis can improve its interface to Django it could be the
winner.
