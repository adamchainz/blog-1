:summary: A super simple assertion helper for comparing instances of Django's Q
          objects.
:scm_path: content/1603-comparing-django-q-objects.rst

Background
----------

When programmatically building complex queries in Django ORM, it's helpful
to be able to test the resulting `Q object instances
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/db/queries/#complex-lookups-with-q>`_
against each other.

However, Django's Q object does not implement ``__cmp__`` and neither does
``Node`` which it extends (``Node`` is in the ``django.utils.tree`` module).

Unfortunately, that means that comparison of Q objects that are equal fails.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from django.db.models import Q
    >>> a = Q(thing='value')
    >>> b = Q(thing='value')
    >>> assert a == b
    Traceback (most recent call last)
    ...
    Assertion Error:

This means that writing unit tests that assert that correct Q objects have been
created is hard.

A simple solution
-----------------

Q objects generate great Unicode representations of themselves:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> a = Q(place='Residential') & Q(people__gt=5)
    >>> unicode(a)
    u"(AND: ('place', 'Residential'), ('people__gt', 5))"

In addition, it is "good" testing practice to write assertion helpers whenever
a test suite has complicated assertions to make frequently. This provides an
opportunity to DRY out test code and expand on any error messages that are
raised on failure.

Therefore a really simple solution is an assertion helper that would compare Q
objects by:

* Asserting that left and right sides are both instances of ``Q``.

* Asserting that the Unicode for the left and right sides are identical.

So here's a mixin containing the assertion helper. It can be added to any class
that extends ``unittest.TestCase`` (such as Django's default ``TestCase``):

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db.models import Q


    class QTestMixin(object):

        def assertQEqual(self, left, right):
            """
            Assert `Q` objects are equal by ensuring that their
            unicode outputs are equal (crappy but good enough)
            """
            self.assertIsInstance(left, Q)
            self.assertIsInstance(right, Q)
            left_u = unicode(left)
            right_u = unicode(right)
            self.assertEqual(left_u, right_u)

Disadvantage of this method is that it is simplistic and doesn't find all the Q
objects that are identical (see below). However, the advantage is that it
provides rich diffs on failure:

.. code-block:: python

    class TestFail(TestCase, QTestMixin):

        def test_unhappy(self):
            """
            Two Q objects are not the same
            """
            a = Q(place='Residential')
            b = Q(place='Palace')
            self.assertQEqual(a, b)

Gives output:

.. code-block:: sh

    AssertionError: u"(AND: ('place', 'Residential'))" != u"(AND: ('place', 'Palace'))"
    - (AND: ('place', 'Residential'))
    ?                  ^^^^^^^^^
    + (AND: ('place', 'Palace'))
    ?                  ^  +++

Which can be very helpful when trying to track down errors.

The perfect world: Predicate Logic
----------------------------------

Since Q objects represent the logic of SQL ``WHERE`` clauses they are therefore
Python representations of predicates. In an ideal world the predicate logic
rules of equality could be used to compare Q objects and this would be built
directly into ``Q.__cmp__``.

This would mean that:

.. code-block:: python

    # WARNING MAGIC IMAGINARY CODE!

    # Commutative would work
    >>> a = Q(x=1) | Q(x=2)
    >>> b = Q(x=2) | Q(x=1)
    >>> a == b
    True

    # Double negation would work
    >>> a = Q(x=1)
    >>> b = ~~(Q=1)
    >>> a == b
    True

    # Negation on expression would work
    >>> a = ~(Q(x=1) & Q(x=2))
    >>> b = ~Q(x=1) | ~Q(x=2)
    >>> a == b
    True

    # END IMAGINATION SECTION

This is probably never going to be implemented in Django, because it would be
functionality only used (as far as I can see) for testing. In addition, without
a special implementation for rendering Q objects diffs, it would be hard to
understand the source of errors when mismatches occur.

Final testing related notes
---------------------------

* When a suite has complicated assertions to test regularly, create an
  assertion helper. Write tests to show that your helper works correctly under
  various conditions.

* Tests for ``assertQEqual`` are `in this gist
  <https://gist.github.com/jamescooke/b9bd5afba3a7253d53bd>`_. (If you spot
  something missing, please let me know!)

* Always consider the output of failing tests - the complexity of managing a
  test suite for a software project can be greatly influenced by how
  informative assertion errors are when they occur.

* A secondary assertion helper could be created to check for inequality
  ``assertQNotEquals``.
