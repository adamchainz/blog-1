:summary: Talk at the first Pyramid London meetup about the Pyramid Router, URL Traversal and Dispatch.

Our first Pyramid London meetup was kindly hosted at `Skills Matter <https://skillsmatter.com/>`_, who have `posted the video of my talk on their page for the meetup <https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/4189-routing-traversal-and-url-dispatch>`_.

All the code I demonstrated is on `GitHub in the pyramid-london-talk repository <https://github.com/jamescooke/pyramid-london-talk>`_ - Please note that the traversal code is in the traversal branch, not in a separate project.

I learned loads from preparing the demonstration code and chatting to everyone that attended - so thanks and hope to see you at the next meetup in June!
